#Project Structure
I followed the app directory structure of Next.js, which helps organize routes, components, and layout efficiently. The project structure is aligned with the new features of Next.js, providing an easy-to-manage codebase.

#Pages and Components
Currently, I have created the Start Working page only, as per the project requirement. The page includes necessary components like the sidebar, header, and other required sections.

#SVG Assets
All SVG files and icons are stored in the public/assets directory for easy access and management.

#Running the Project
To run the development server:

# bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
